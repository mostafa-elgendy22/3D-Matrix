# 3D-Matrix

## Brief:
A 3D matrix is to be stored in 1D vector using index conversion from (i, j, k) to (y), the program takes the input a from text file in the 'input_files' directory

## Input format description:
1. The first line in the input text file contains three numbers (n, m, p)
2. n is the number of 2D matrices (note that a 3D matrix is an array of 2D matrices)
3. (m, p) is the size of each of the 2D matrices (m is the number of rows, p is the number of columns)
4. Then write (n * m * p) numbers in any format (It is better to follow the input format of the two given input files to visualize the matrix better)


## Requirements to build the project:
1. CMake
2. MinGW


## Running the program:

```
./bin/3D_matrix
```
